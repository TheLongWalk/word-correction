##Word-Correction

This project aims to autocorrect some wrongly typed turkish words with high accuracy.

In order to run this project, you shall download the [zemberek](github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp) jar files. At the time of writing this, I used 0.11.1 version of the zemberek project. After you managed to download these jars, add them into your classpath. Now we should be able to run our nano application.
