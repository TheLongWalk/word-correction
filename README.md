## Word-Correction

This project aims to autocorrect some wrongly typed Turkish words with high accuracy.

In order to run this application, download the [zemberek](github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp) jar files.
At the time of writing this, I used 0.11.1 version of the zemberek project.
After you download these jars, add them into your classpath.
Now you should be able to run this nano application.
